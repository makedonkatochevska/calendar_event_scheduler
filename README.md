## Project Description

This project allows users to:

- Add new events to a calendar by selecting a date and entering a description.
- View a list of all scheduled events.
- Filter events based on the next seven days.
- Remove specific events.
- Preserve events using `localStorage`, so they remain even after refreshing the browser.

## Instructions

To use the Calendar Event Scheduler:

- Select a date using the date input field.
- Enter a description for your event.
- Click the **"Add Event"** button to schedule it.
- The event will appear in the list of scheduled events.
- The app automatically creates buttons for the next 7 days.
- Click a date button to filter and view only events scheduled for that specific day.
- To remove an event, click the **"Remove"** button next to it.
- All events are stored in your browser’s **localStorage**, so they will remain even after refreshing the page.
